//Code with Mosh JS file 1



// operators exercise 

let a = 'red';
let b = 'blue';

//swap values of red and blue here, only operators because thats the section this is. hes gonna mean this solution:
let storeA = a;  //storeA is 'red'
a = b; //a is 'blue'
b = storeA; //b is 'red'


console.log("Now blue - " + a);
console.log("Now red - " + b);
